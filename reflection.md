Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

Cafe...

1) I overloaded the constructor so that a user could decide the amount of supplies their cafe has. 

2) I modified sell coffee so that customers who do not specify what they want get a default coffee. 

Library...

1) The library constructor so that every library can change its name but will get a general default address and a default number of floors(2).

2) I overloaded the checkout so that the user must also input the return date when checking out kind of like a reminder. 

House... 

1) Different constructor. Since most houses on campus do not have a dining hall and elevator, this constructor assumes that this house has neither.

2) A string name is input only with no further details, and uses the method getName from student to try and find the student.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked was figuring out how to override the different files. I found that easy. What was difficult was trying to firgure out how to overload. I was trying to do it with a 'correct' answer in mind, when in reality, anything is okay as long as it performs a similar action as the original method. By meeting with my professor to better understand certain methods ands overloading, this assignment became easier. I had a lot of difficulty with overloading the Library constructor but if you really take your time and try to understand the class and superclass, it may work.
